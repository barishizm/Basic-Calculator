# Basic Calculator

A minimal command-line calculator written in Python. The script prompts for two numbers and an arithmetic operation, then prints the result.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later

## Usage

Run the script with Python and follow the prompts:

```bash
python main.py
```

You will be asked to:

1. Enter the first number.
2. Select an operation: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`.
3. Enter the second number.

The calculator supports floating-point input and reports an error for division by zero or an invalid operation selection.
